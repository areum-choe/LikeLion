review
  We made hot chocolate bombs. Love the size and how the mold peels right off the chocolate without breaking it! Kids had a blast! Would recommend!
"  Ok I was skeptical and watched so many videos to not mess up the process. Turns out that I believe what's important is the quality of chocolate you use. Anything that stays solid at room temperature and is semi gourmet is perfect! Candy bars not so much as they melt while handling. Stuffed full with baby marshmallows and hot chocolate nesquick mix and some brown sugar. My boys loved the rich bombs made in milk. The balls are large and perfect size to fit in a big mug. I stored ours in the fridge.We also painted on two layers of chocolate and cooled in the fridge after each layer. Areas to be careful with are the bomb edges that seal as well as the bottom center, i ended up with a couple holes. No harm done still tasty just not pretty. Yes i recommend it and yes i would buy it again."
  I love how easy these are to use!! Great for beginners!!
  These were so easy to use. Easy to clean as well. The chocolate popped right out once set. I think this is a great price and value. My first time making hot cocoa bombs was a success because of these molds. There are so many to choose from on Amazon but I think I made the right choice for sure!
"  The mold was the perfect size for a hot chocolate bomb! I read so many reviews before purchasing trying to get something that would be the right size, delivered quickly, & was easy to use. This mold was all of the above. As some mentioned, it is thin, buy that allows for easy removal of the molded item. It does also make it a little flattened on the ends because of that, so we used a cookie sheet underneath to help as it was so flexible and also put some bunched up parchment paper underneath to help take the pressure off of it sitting on the flat surface and it worked great. Kind of a pain to have to do that, but if the mold was harder it would make getting the stuff out of the molds harder. I am very happy with these molds and would purchase them again."
"  This product shipped fast and arrived on time. Good quality and makes an over 2"" hot cocoa bomb.Very happy with this purchase. I bought 2 sets of 3 !! Easy to clean, easy to use."
"  Too flimsy, received a refund. A $10 gift card is offered for a five star review!"
"  Great product!  Worked well!  Update The product works fine...nothing extraordinary, but I only wrote this review because they promised a Amazon gift card but never delivered on it...so I'm giving it 1 star because they lied and didn't fulfill their promise.  That is all."
"  First time making chocolate bombs and while the first one didn’t turn out great because my hands were too warm, the silicone molds made it very easy to remove!  These spheres are 2.5 inches in diameter and are the perfect size for chocolate bombs! Also very easy to wash - just put them in the dishwasher!  I didn’t have any silicone smell after I put it in the dishwasher as soon as I got it."
"  Unlike other seller which never delivered, after 2 weeks we ordered from them.  Super fast delivery even during Christmas! The mold worked great for the cocoa bomb even my 8 year old was able to make them.  Very happy!"
